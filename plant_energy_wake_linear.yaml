description: wake definition for a plant energy production model

# Draft schema definitions for energy model
definitions:
  wake_steady: # sebastian - Was it called linear for the linear decay of Jensen?
    type: model
    description: an individual wind turbine wake model

      # sebastian - I changed properties to inputs and outputs.
    inputs:
      # sebastian - I don't think air_density is an input to any of the common steady wake models.
      # air_density:
      #   type: number
      #   description: air density associated with operating mode
      #   units: kg / m^3
      #   default: 1.225
      #   minimum: 0.5

      wind_speed:
        type: number
        description: The current wind speed at hub height
        minimum: 0.0
        # maximum: 200.0 # Sebastian - I don't think we need to preset a maximum wind speed.
        units: m/s

      downstream_distance:
        type: number
        description: Downstream distance where deficit is to be calculated. Frame of reference rotated with upstream wind direction.
        minimum: 0.0

      # sebastian - I added this
      crosswind_distance:
        type: number
        description: Crosswind distance from wake centerline to where deficit is to be calculated. Perpendicular to downstream distance.

     #Ewan suggests including this (for discussion)
     # Sebastian - I agree, as this is an input to FLORIS.
      yaw:

        # maximum: 0.40
      

      # This one opens up a whole suite of model calibration parameters for every other model out there. I suggest to remove these parameters from the ontology, as they are part of the model. Not output from another tool.
